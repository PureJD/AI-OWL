# AI Owl
### This is a program that displays a wise owl in the forest who is surrounded by fireflies and can answer any question (using AI), in the context of being an owl. The idea behind this program is to demonstrate the future utilisation of AI in video games. Characters can be spoken to and provide unique answers every time.

#### - Once the user boots the program they are met with an owl and fireflies that move across the screen in random directions. 
#### - The code performs the following;
- Creates the pygame window
- Draws the fireflies and owl onto the screen
- Accepts the user input which is represented at the bottom of the screen
- Sends the user input through the AI function which sends the question through the OpenAI API along with the context for the question
- This then returns the answer from the API and represents it on screen
